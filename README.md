Coding Kata Excercises in Java

This repository represents the start of a collection of short programs in Java, which are to be re-written as often as possible (ideally daily) in order to refine programming skills. The repository has been created due to a lack of online resources for such a training method - as such, I will review and accept any new programs and/or changes proposed.
