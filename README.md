Coding Kata Excercises in Java

This repository represents the start of a collection of short programs in Java, which are to be re-written as often as possible (ideally daily) in order to refine programming skills. The repository is open to any new programs and/or changes proposed.

To implement next: all Katas found at the URL http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataCatalogue

A few handy Java screencasts can be found at: http://www.codekatas.org/casts/tagged/java

Coding Bat Java (http://codingbat.com/java) has an amazing supply of practice excercises - it would be good to incorporate the best of these here. 

Another resource to look into is http://www.codewars.com/kata/latest && http://www.java2novice.com/java-interview-programs/

Long-term TODO: 
- Sort into a training program. On one hand, this should classify groups of excercises that cover as many bases as possible in a certain amount of time, i.e. folders for "30 minute workout," "45 minute workout," and "One hour workout." On the other hand, it should also feature a marathon-like training schedule. I am undecided as to whether this should reference the set workouts, or have its own.

- Incorporate Test Cases

- Develop user interface and offer Kata as a software

- Develop a similar Android Kata
